                The global shift towards remote work has fundamentally transformed how organizations operate and communicate. 
                Cloud computing platforms have become the backbone of modern remote work infrastructure, enabling employees 
                to access company resources from anywhere with an internet connection. Video conferencing tools like Zoom, 
                Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet have replaced traditional face-to-face meetings, allowing teams to collaborate 
                effectively across geographical boundaries.
